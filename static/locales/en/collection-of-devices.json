    "details": "Every device in your collection is unique and has its own trust score. Trust scores help you set unique policies for each device. For instance, some devices may not have secure hardware, or some may show signs of malicious tampering. Distribute trust scores to moderate the level of connectivity and control that each device has over your collection. As an example, you may want your phone to have different access to your main balance of RvT for policy purchases than your connected fridge or TV."
